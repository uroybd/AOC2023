# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

**Language**: Rust

Every day has a dedicated file in the `solutions` directory, and two inputs (one the actual input, another the example suffixed with 'e') in the `inputs` directory.

Shamelessly stole and adapted [the scaffolding mechanism found here](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust) to my need.
